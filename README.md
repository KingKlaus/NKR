Object Oriented UML Modeling for ATM Systems

Abstract
The Object-Oriented Modeling assists the programmer to address the complexity of a problem domain by considering the problem not as a set of functions that can be performed but primarily as a set of related, interacting Objects. This article is based on the approach of Object Oriented modeling through Unified Modeling Language (UML) for an ATM system in banking sector. The main aim of this article is to provide a flexible and faithful environment for a customer, who wants to do online banking transactions. After successful authentication, the customer can withdraw the desire amount (within the prescribed limit) from the ATM machine or can transfer amount to other account. User can also change the pin code. The ATM has solved many problems and now customer can have money transaction 24/7. In this article UML Class, Interaction diagram, Activity diagram & Use Case diagram are also designed for the ATM System. 

Key Words: UML dynamic modeling, UML static modeling, Use case modelling

Introduction  
The  Unified  Modeling  Language  (UML)  is  a  very dominant  modeling  graphical  language  for  specifying, constructing  and  documenting  the  artifacts  of  software system.  UML is simply another graphical representation of a common semantic model.  UML  provides  a comprehensive  notation  for  the  full  lifecycle  of  object-oriented  development  UML  is  a  collection  of  best engineering practices that have successful in the modeling for a design of  a  huge  and  complex  systems.  Modeling is very important for readability and reuse of the systems. 

Features of ATM Systems
The ATM will service one customer at a time. A customer will  be  required  to  insert  an  ATM  card  and  enter  a personal identification number (PIN) - both of which  will be  sent  to  the  bank  for  validation  as  part  of  each transaction.  The customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions.  

Object-Oriented Analysis
Object-oriented  analysis  looks  at  the  problem  domain, with  the  aim  of  producing  a  conceptual  model  of  the information  that  exists  in  the  area  being  analyzed. Analysis models do not consider any implementation constraints or how the system is to be built. The identified objects reflect entities and operations that are associated with the problem to be solved.

Conclusion:
As we are still working on this project , so far we know that OOAD is very important especially while you are designing  an atm system and our team believes that  the atm design  is simple and  is easy to use as a cardholder. As   it provides you more than one option and allows you to create more than one accounts as desired.
